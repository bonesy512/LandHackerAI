            <p className="text-muted-foreground max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center">
              Founded by Thomas Schustereit, a visionary in the proptech space, LandHacker.ai was born from a simple yet powerful idea: to democratize access to real estate data and empower professionals to find and close deals faster than ever before. Frustrated by the fragmented and inefficient tools available, Thomas assembled a team of seasoned real estate experts and brilliant software engineers to build the solution they always wished they had.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center">
              Today, LandHacker.ai is the culmination of that visionâ€”a comprehensive platform dedicated to serving the modern real estate investor, agent, and wholesaler. We are committed to continuous innovation, guided by the real-world needs of our community, as we build the future of property technology together.
